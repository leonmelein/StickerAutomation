# Sticker Packs

Place your stickers here. Create a new folder for each pack you want to make.

## Required files
Each pack should be in one seperate folder. Each must have the following files:
- `{pack}/title.txt`: the title of the pack 
- `{pack}/author.txt`: the author of the pack 
- `{pack}/0.png`: the tray icon of the pack in the WhatsApp sticker picker
- `{pack}/1-30.webp`: the stickers themselves (at least 3, max 30)

### Title and Author
Both files are regular text files containing only the title or author. No other markup is needed.

### Tray Icon
The tray icon should be 96x96px exactly in the PNG image format, and no larger than 50kb.

### Stickers
Stickers should be 512x512px exactly, in the WebP image format. They must have a transparant background and be no larger than 100kb. See [WhatsApp's guidance](https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/how-to-create-stickers-for-whatsapp/?lang=en) for more info and tips.
